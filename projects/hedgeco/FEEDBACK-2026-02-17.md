# HedgeCo Feedback — 2026-02-17

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Audit staging.hedgeco.net (NOT hedgeco.net)

## Issues Identified

### Authentication & Access Control
- [ ] No Google OAuth in registration — needs to be added
- [ ] Auto-approval on signup — WRONG! Should require TWO-STEP approval:
  1. **Email verification** — user verifies email
  2. **Accredited investor status** — admin approves accreditation
- [ ] Both approvals required before seeing fund/SPV details

### Data Visibility Rules
- [ ] **Non-registered users**: Can see teaser data only (NO fund names, limited info)
- [ ] **Registered but not approved**: Still restricted
- [ ] **Fully approved users**: Full access to fund and SPV details
- [ ] This is a compliance requirement — treat seriously

### Visual / Branding
- [ ] Colors are off — need to match existing site exactly
- [ ] Logos are wrong/missing — pull from current staging site

### Missing Sections
- [ ] Footer tabs — need to match existing site
- [ ] Hedgecuation section — educational content area
- [ ] **SPV section** — completely missing!

### General
- [ ] Frontend needs thorough audit against **staging.hedgeco.net**
- [ ] Team needs to go through current site page-by-page and recreate exactly

## Action Items

1. **Daphne (Frontend)**: Audit existing hedgeco.net thoroughly
   - Screenshot every page
   - Document exact colors, fonts, spacing
   - Map all footer links and sections
   - Capture Hedgecuation section structure

2. **Shaggy (Backend)**: 
   - Add Google OAuth provider
   - Implement admin approval workflow for new registrations
   - User status: PENDING → APPROVED flow

3. **All**: The goal is to recreate the existing site exactly first, THEN modernize

*This is a rebuild, not a redesign. Match the original.*
