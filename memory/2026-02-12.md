- Fund Database — **requires login** 🔒
- SPV Search — **requires login** 🔒
- Admin panel (/myadmin) — **need credentials** 🔒

## HedgeCo.Net Rebuild Project Initiated

Evan tasked me with a major project: complete rebuild of hedgeco.net.

**What it is:** A 20+ year old PHP-based hedge fund database — one of the leading free alternative investment databases. Covers hedge funds, private equity, VC, real estate, crypto funds, and SPVs.

**The mission:** Rebuild with modern architecture and make it AI-native. The AI features are the differentiator.

**Key features to rebuild:**
- Investor accreditation flow
- Fund database with performance stats
- Service provider directory (paid)
- Returns calculation engine + PDF reports
- Internal messaging
- Admin panel

**AI features to add:**
- Natural language search
- Personalized recommendations
- AI-powered communications
- Intelligent matching

**Credentials provided** for manager, investor, and admin accounts to explore staging.hedgeco.net.

Starting discovery phase now.
