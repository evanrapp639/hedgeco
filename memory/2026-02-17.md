## HedgeCo Sprint 8: Polish, Reports & Deployment

### Completed by Sub-agents
- **🧣 Shaggy**: Scheduled reports (cron-based), email campaigns with scheduling/stats, bulk export system (funds/users/analytics/contacts), all routers registered
- **🧢 Fred**: Docker multi-stage build, docker-compose (app/postgres/redis), GitHub Actions CI/CD, health check endpoints (/api/health, /api/health/ready), monitoring setup, environment docs, smoke + performance E2E tests
- **🧡 Daphne**: Customizable dashboard with drag-drop widgets (7 types: stats, charts, list, quick links, watchlist, performance, news), report builder wizard, email campaign builder, empty states, skeletons, error boundaries

### Build Fixes Applied
- `export-queue.ts`: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for Prisma Json fields
- `export-queue.ts`: Array.from(jobStore) for Map iteration
- PDF report templates (`src/lib/reports/*.tsx`): Temporarily disabled due to @react-pdf/renderer type issues with Line/Path SVG elements
- `report-generator.ts`: Rewritten without PDF templates, Excel/CSV only for now

### Current Build Status
- Still running type checks
- PDF templates moved to .bak files pending type fixes
- Core functionality working: scheduled reports, campaigns, exports, dashboards, widgets

### New Prisma Models (Sprint 8)
- ScheduledReport, ReportExecution
- EmailCampaign (status: DRAFT/SCHEDULED/SENDING/SENT/CANCELLED)
- ExportJob (type: FUNDS/USERS/ANALYTICS/CONTACTS/DEALS)
